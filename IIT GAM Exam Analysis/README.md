## Before one week my brother came to me and approch this project's idea, he has IIT GAM Exam in Feb 2021.

## Is there any patternt in answers of IIT GAM exams?
## Well, for an instance we say no way. But without proving it, it's not fun. And certainly when it comes to exam we really wanna give it a shot.

## Data Collecting and Cleaning Part was really pain in ass. I went through nearly all the website to find data in csv form. But no help. Then I decided to convert pdf page into csv file by online converters. The result was surprizingy good. Simply modification on the final converted file can give you good data. But still it was a terrible journey.

## After collecting and cleaning I just draw meaningful bar charts in deployed whole notebook on heroku platform. You can find different notebook for different work. It's in this order

- IIT JAM
- IIT INSIGHTS
- IIT INSIGHTS DEPLOYMENT

## Check The Results
